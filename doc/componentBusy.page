## Component `busy` Property

When working with async data requests in single page apps, it's common
for a component to need to mark itself as busy while making data
requests.

To support this the Component implements a boolean `busy` property
that can be used in templates to show a spinner or other indicator.

When the value of the `busy` property is changed, the component is
automatically invalidated for update.
