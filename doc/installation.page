## Installation

CodeOnly is available from the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/toptensoftware/codeonly

Or, as an NPM package:

```
npm install --save github:toptensoftware/codeonly
```

If using as a NPM package and your back-end server is written
in ExpressJS, [bundle-free](https://github.com/toptensoftware/bundle-free)
is a simple middleware that lets you reference NPM modules directly
from the front-end client and works great with CodeOnly.
