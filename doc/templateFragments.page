### Fragments

If a template element doesn't have a type, it's considered a "fragment" 
or multi-root element.  Any child elements of the fragment will be included directly in the fragment's parent.

In this example, the one `if` condition either includes or excludes all three paragraphs from the containing div:

```js
{
    type: 'div':
    $: {
        // No 'type' here, so this is a fragment
        if: c => someCondition,
        $: [
            { type: "p", $: "Para 1" }
            { type: "p", $: "Para 2" }
            { type: "p", $: "Para 3" }
        ]
    }
}
```
