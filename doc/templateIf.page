# Conditionally Including Items

The `if` attribute can be used to dynamically include or exclude an element from the DOM:

(Note: while the `display` attribute just hides an element, `if` completely excludes it)

```js
{
    type: "div",
    $: [
        {
            if: c => showError,
            type: "p",
            $: "Failed: ...",
        }
    ]
}
```

You can also include one or more `elseif` blocks and an optional `else` block:

```js
{
    type: "div",
    $: [
        {
            if: c => showError,
            type: "p",
            $: "Error: ...",
        },
        {
            elseif: c => showWarning,
            type: "p",
            $: "Warning: ...",
        },
        {
            else: true,     // Value ignored
            type: "p",
            $: "All OK",
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: `if`, `elseif` and `else` conditional elements must all follow each other consecutively in the containing array.
