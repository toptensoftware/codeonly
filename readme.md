# CodeOnly

A simple, lightweight, code-only, tooling-free front-end Web framework.

Unlike other front-end frameworks, CodeOnly is not reactive so there are
no wrapper or proxy classes around your objects and everything is kept 
as close to pure JavaScript as possible.

CodeOnly is also tool-free: no cross compiling, transpiling, packaging, 
bundling.  No waiting for tooling and you can debug your code in the 
browser exactly as you wrote it.

Of course, CodeOnly is compatible with bundling for production distribution 
so you get the best of both worlds.
