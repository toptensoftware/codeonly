# Component `loading` Property

When working with async data requests in single page apps, it's common
for a component to need to mark itself as loading while making data
requests.

To support this the Component implements a boolean `loading` property
that can be used in templates to show a spinner or other indicator.

When the value of the `loading` property is changed, the component is
automatically invalidated for update.

## `loaded` Event

The `loaded` event is fired after the first update when the `loading` 
property was true but is now false.

This event is used by the Router to determine when a page load is
complete and view state (eg: scroll position) can be restored.
