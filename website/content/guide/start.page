# Getting Started

There's a variety of ways you can use CodeOnly, so the best way to
get started will depend on what you're trying to achieve.

## CodeOnly Lab

If you just want to experiment with and learn about CodeOnly, the 
<a href="/lab">CodeOnly Lab</a> is the perfect way to get started. 
You can write simple components and experiment with them right in 
your browser.

* The Lab expects a component class called "Main" as the entry point
  to your experiment.

* Save your experiments by clicking the Copy Link button - that'll 
  copy a link to your clipboard that you can use to share your 
  experiments and to reload them later.

* Clicking the "Copy Link" button also places the link in the browser 
  address bar so you can refresh to get back to a previous save point
  or use browser bookmarks to save your experiments.

* The ".html" button will download a .html file containing your 
  experiment.  You'll still need a web connection to run it because it
  gets JavaScript and CSS files from the CodeOnly site, but it's an
  easy way to make a simple web app.

* The Lab only supports a single source code file but you can still 
  create multiple component classes - just put them one after the 
  other.
